Using this study as a guide ~~[http://infosthetics.com/archives/2012/07/dyslexic_notation.html](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2012/07/dyslexic_notation.html)~~ (website appears to be gone, here's an image of it on behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/6031659/Dyslexic-Notation-Conceptual-Typeface), this is a "dyslexic notation" typeface that uses symmetric symbols to reduce confusion in the alphabet. 

After playing around with it a bit, I would like to see something like this become the standard english alphabet, but aside from that, it may hinder rather than help progress.

Still, if you'd like to make this your ereader font, etc. here it is.

For practical reasons, you should probably generate this as a bold, italic and bold italic font, all exactly the same, to avoid errant and distracting normal letters from popping up. I setup emphasis by tilting the letters, and added the missing colors now that its a supported thing.

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

This was also created using Glyphs on a Mac. For you font-forge types, there is a generated otf in here you can use to play with. If you use it regularly, ping me.

I've added a .ttf file in case anyone wants to play with that also. It has the encoding information, etc. that Windows needs to properly display it. 

I'm making no recommendation on using this in production or business, etc use. It's significantly different, where it would not expect it to help in most non-personal-use cases.
