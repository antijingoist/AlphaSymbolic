Using this study as a guide ~~[http://infosthetics.com/archives/2012/07/dyslexic_notation.html](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2012/07/dyslexic_notation.html)~~ (website appears to be gone, here's an image of it on behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/6031659/Dyslexic-Notation-Conceptual-Typeface), this is a "dyslexic notation" typeface that uses symmetric symbols to reduce confusion in the alphabet. Changes were made to remove ambiguous characters on devices that don't support color typefaces, and black outlines around the colors so the lighter letters don't dissapear into the background.

Two styles were created: Regular and Bold. Bold was made to indicate emphasis alone, and as such shares its appearance with italic. There are no uppercase or lowercase letters, and work has been done on only basic Latin.

After playing around with it a bit, I would like to see something like this become the standard english alphabet, but aside from that, it may hinder rather than help progress.

Still, if you'd like to make this your ereader font, etc. here it is.

For practical reasons, you should probably generate this as a bold, italic and bold italic font, all exactly the same, to avoid errant and distracting normal letters from popping up. I setup emphasis by tilting the letters, and added the missing colors now that its a supported thing.

This was also created using Glyphs on a Mac. For you font-forge types, there is a generated otf in here you can use to play with. If you use it regularly, ping me.

I'm making no recommendation on using this in production or business, etc use. It's significantly different, where it would not expect it to help in most non-personal-use cases.
